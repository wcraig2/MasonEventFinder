Additonal things:
All of the barebones functionality for the website have been implemented.
I have marked the areas that are in need of testing, but since most of this project
falls under the second category as noted in the P4 Deliverable, so testing shouldn't be too intense.

If you find any more areas that can be tested, feel free to add such tests.
